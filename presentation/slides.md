# 🔑 Key Management

I need a base Universal Profile, Key Manager and key to perform the actions.

Add permissions to a KeyManager and demo working/non working transactions / Screenshot / Demo of the Extension?

Real life examples (marketplace etc.)

---

# 📝 Custom Metadata

Easy to write and decode with ERC725js -> show examples of existing collections with erc725inspect and demo how to write

---

# 📢 Relayed Calls

Show the relayer, from the extension to the dashboard

Execute a transaction on the behalf of someone, with the right permissions ofc?
